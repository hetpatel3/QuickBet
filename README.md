# Slot Machine Simulator

This is a console-based slot machine simulator implemented in JavaScript. Users can input deposit amounts, choose the number of lines to bet on, and specify the bet amount per line. The program then simulates spins, calculates winnings based on winning combinations, and updates the user's balance accordingly.

## Features

- **Number of Lines:** Users can choose the number of lines to bet on (between 1 to 3).
- **Bet Amount:** Users can specify the bet amount per line, ensuring it doesn't exceed the current balance.
- **Simulation:** The program simulates spins by randomly selecting symbols for each reel.
- **Winning Combinations:** Winning combinations are determined based on matching symbols on the selected lines.
- **Payouts:** Winnings are calculated dynamically based on the bet amount and the value of the matched symbols.
- **Balance Management:** The user's balance is updated after each spin, considering the bet amount and any winnings.
